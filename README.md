# Snake Mines

This project was developed as part of my undergraduate mathematics education project.

The game is designed to teach students key mathematical concepts through gameplay, including:

- Coordinate transformations (reflection, translation, symmetry, rotation)
- Basic probability (independent and mutually exclusive events)

# Files included
`Snake_Mines_coding.py`: Main game file built using Python and Pygame.

# How to run:

snake_mines.py is work on 'Replit' online coding website.
